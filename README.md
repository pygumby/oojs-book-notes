## 1. Overview

Since I can never remember how exactly JavaScript's â€” or rather ES5's â€” prototypes and prototypal inheritance work, I finally created this cheat sheet.
It's based on chapter 4 of the aforementioned book.

## 2. Usage

To check out the cheatsheet, view the file [src/app.js](src/app.js).
To run the example code, do `npm install`.
Then, follow the instructions specified in [src/app.js](src/app.js) on how to un-comment the section you want to run and do `npm run-script all`.

## 3. Progress

This repository contains most of the information presented in chapter 4 of the aforementioned book â€” and then some.
